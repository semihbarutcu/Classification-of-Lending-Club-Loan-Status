# Lending-Club-Loan-Status-Prediction

In this project, Lending Club accepted loan data was studied. Loan status was response variable and I worked on both 84 remaining variable and selected 10 remaining variable.

3 different algorithms were implemented to the data. 1 alternative way and 1 boosting method were used to check and improve models. kNN method had least accurate results for test data while random forests had best which is 84.64%. Ranger gave same results with randomForest package but execution time was smaller, 2.91 sec vs 18.99 sec respectively.  C5.0 method results very close to random forest while boosting does not help to improve accuracy of outcomes.
